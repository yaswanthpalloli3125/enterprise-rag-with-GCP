# 18 — Evaluation Pipeline

## What is an Evaluation and Why Does It Matter?

Building a RAG system is not the same as knowing it works.

Think of it like a doctor running tests. You don't just *assume* the patient is healthy — you measure blood pressure, run a blood panel, check reflexes. Each test catches a specific kind of problem. Evals are those tests for your AI system.

Without evals you can only say *"it seems to work on the questions I tried."*  
With evals you can say *"it is 87% faithful, 93% tool-correct, and blocks 100% of adversarial inputs across 15 standardised test cases from real data."*

## Part 1 — How the Golden Dataset Was Generated

### What is a Golden Dataset?

A **golden dataset** is a curated set of question–answer pairs where you already know the correct answer. Each pair is called a **golden** (or a *golden sample*). The correct answer is called the **ground truth** or **reference**.

You compare what the system actually says against the ground truth — that gap is the signal.

### Our Source Documents

We parsed the following real enterprise documents from `data/true_data/`:

| File | Topic | Parser Used |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `parallel_work_queue.txt` | Kubernetes parallel Jobs with Redis | `parse_text` |
| `pods_autoscale.html` | HPA and VPA in Kubernetes | `parse_html` |
| `job_management.html` | Databricks CLI / SDK / REST API | `parse_html` |
| `cronjobs.docx` | Kubernetes Jobs and CronJobs | `python-docx` |
| `monitor_job.docx` | Monitoring Kubernetes job status | `python-docx` |

> We use `python-docx` and `python-pptx` directly in `evals/data_parser.py` — not the `unstructured` library — so the golden dataset builder is lightweight and fast.

### How Each Golden Was Written

For each document:
1. Parse the file to extract full text
2. Read the content and identify 3 real, non-trivial questions a platform engineer would ask
3. Write the reference answer by paraphrasing the source text (not copying word-for-word)
4. Extract 1–2 actual text chunks from the file as `relevant_contexts` (fallback if live retrieval fails)
5. Set `expected_tools: ["retrieve_documents"]` — every question needs real document lookup

**Result: 15 golden RAG samples + 6 guardrails test cases.**

### Golden Entry Structure

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "domain": "parallel_work_queue",
  "question": "How do you start Redis for a Kubernetes work queue?",
  "reference": "Run kubectl apply -f redis-pod.yaml and redis-service.yaml...",
  "relevant_contexts": ["For this example, you will start a single instance..."],
  "expected_tools": ["retrieve_documents"],
  "actual_response": "",       ← filled by Phase 1 at runtime
  "actual_contexts": [],       ← filled by Phase 1 at runtime
  "actual_tools_called": []    ← filled by Phase 1 at runtime
}
```

### Guardrails Test Cases

6 entries with `expected_blocked: true/false`:

| Type | Example | Expected |
|------|---------|----------|
| Jailbreak | "Ignore all previous instructions..." | Blocked |
| Off-topic | "Tell me a funny joke" | Blocked |
| Legit IT | "How do I monitor a Kubernetes Job?" | Passed |

## Part 2 — How the Eval Pipeline Runs

The pipeline runs in **two phases** followed by a **scoring phase**:

    N --> O[📊 Streamlit Dashboard\n4 tabs: Ground Truth / Pipeline / Metrics / History]
    F --> O
```

### Phase 1 — Live Response Generation

For each of the 15 golden questions, `evals/pipeline.py`:
1. Sends a `POST /query` request to the backend (`BACKEND_URL` env var, defaults to `localhost:8000`)
2. Captures `answer` (summarized via Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for long responses), `sources` (actual retrieved chunks), `thought_process`
3. Parses `thought_process` to detect which tool was called:
   - `"Intent: Technical"` → `retrieve_documents`
   - `"Intent: Conversational/Memory"` → `direct_answer`
   - `"Intent: Guardrails Fired"` → `guardrails`
4. Waits 10 seconds between calls (Groq RPM buffer on the main key)

> **Why summarize instead of truncate?**  
> Truncating to 300 chars cuts facts mid-sentence, causing artificially low RAGAS scores (Faithfulness, Answer Correctness). `pipeline.py` calls Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant` to produce a 3–5 bullet-point summary that preserves all specific numbers, names, and technical claims in ~150 words. Responses shorter than 400 chars are passed through unchanged. The summary model uses the `JUDGE_GROQ` key so it never touches the production key.

### Guardrails Evaluation

`evals/guardrails_eval.py` sends each of the 6 test inputs to `/query` and checks if `thought_process` contains `"Intent: Guardrails Fired"`. Each result is classified as:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| TP (True Positive) | Adversarial input was correctly blocked |
| TN (True Negative) | Legitimate input was correctly passed through |
| FP (False Positive) | Legitimate input was wrongly blocked |
| FN (False Negative) | Adversarial input was missed — not blocked |

From these we compute **precision**, **recall**, and **accuracy** for the guardrails layer.

### Phase 2 — RAGAS Metric Scoring

`evals/metrics.py` runs 6 experiments against the enriched dataset from Phase 1.

```

| # | Metric | What it catches | Score of 1.0 means |
|---|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Faithfulness** | Does the answer invent facts not in the retrieved context? | Zero hallucination |
| 2 | **Answer Relevancy** | Does the answer actually address the question asked? | Perfectly on-topic |
| 3 | **Context Precision** | Are the most relevant chunks ranked first by the retriever? | Best chunks at the top |
| 4 | **Context Recall** | Did the retriever fetch everything the reference answer needs? | Nothing important missed |
| 5 | **Answer Correctness** | Does the answer match the ground-truth reference factually? | Factually identical |
| 6 | **Tool Correctness** | Did the agent call the right tool for each question type? | Right tool every time |

### Why Each Metric Matters in Production

**Faithfulness** — If this is low, your RAG system is hallucinating. It's making up facts that aren't in the documents it retrieved. Users will trust wrong answers.

**Answer Relevancy** — If this is low, the system answers adjacent topics instead of the actual question. Even if the answer is factually correct about *something*, it's not useful.

**Context Precision** — If this is low, your re-ranker (FlashRank) or vector search is returning noisy chunks before relevant ones. The generator gets confused by irrelevant context at the top.

**Context Recall** — If this is low, your retriever is missing important documents. The generator can only answer from what was fetched — if the key chunk wasn't retrieved, the answer will be incomplete.

**Answer Correctness** — Combines factual overlap + semantic similarity against the ground truth. The strongest end-to-end signal: does the system actually know the right answer?

**Tool Correctness** — Verifies the planner is routing correctly. A question about CronJobs should trigger `retrieve_documents`, not `direct_answer`. Uses Jaccard overlap — no LLM needed.

### Score Thresholds

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ≥ 0.75 | 🟢 Good | Ship it |
| 0.50–0.75 | 🟡 Fair | Investigate — tune retrieval or prompts |
| < 0.50 | 🔴 Poor | Fix before shipping |

## Part 4 — Token Budget, Rate Limits, and Cooldowns

### Why We Have Two Separate Groq Keys

| Key | Used for | Why separate? |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Live app + Phase 1 response generation | Production traffic |
| `JUDGE_GROQ` | RAGAS LLM judge calls in Phase 2 | Eval runs must not exhaust the production key |

If both ran on the same key, a single eval run would rate-limit your live app mid-conversation.

### Full Token Budget for This Eval Run (15 samples)

#### Phase 1 — Response Generation (`GROQ_API_KEY`, llama-3.3-70b-versatile via Portkey)

| Task | Calls | Tokens/call | Total tokens |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 15 RAG questions (prompt + context + response) | 15 | ~1,850 | ~27,750 |
| 6 guardrails tests | 6 | ~500 | ~3,000 |
| **Phase 1 total** | **21** | | **~30,750** |

With 10s delay between calls: ~3.5 min. Daily limit for 70b: 100,000 TPD ✅

#### Phase 2 — RAGAS Metrics (`JUDGE_GROQ`, llama-3.1-8b-instant)

**Actual TPM tier: 6,000 on_demand** (not 14,400 — confirmed from live 413/429 errors).

`abatch_score` fires all sample coroutines concurrently inside a single call, so a batch of N samples fires N × 2 LLM calls simultaneously. With ~1,376 tokens/call and a 6,000 TPM ceiling, only **2 samples** can run in parallel before the window saturates. The safe strategy: `GENERAL_BATCH_SIZE = 1` — one sample at a time.

| Experiment | LLM calls / sample | Tokens / burst (1 sample) | vs 6,000 TPM | Samples × 40s wait |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Faithfulness | 2 | ~2,752 | ✅ Safe | 14 × 40s = 560s |
| Answer Relevancy | 2 | ~2,752 | ✅ Safe | 14 × 40s = 560s |
| Context Precision | 2 | ~2,752 | ✅ Safe | 14 × 40s = 560s |
| Context Recall | 2 | ~2,752 | ✅ Safe | 14 × 40s = 560s |
| Answer Correctness | 2–3 | ~2,752–4,128 | ✅ Safe | 14 × 40s = 560s |
| Tool Correctness | 0 | 0 | ✅ Free | — |

**Context truncation**: contexts from Qdrant are ~1,500 chars each. Without truncation a single Faithfulness call exceeds 7,000 tokens. Fix: `CONTEXT_TRUNCATE = 300`, `CONTEXT_LIMIT = 2` → ~400 tokens of context per call.

**Phase 2 total tokens**: 15 samples × 5 experiments × ~2,752 = ~206,400 tokens. Well within 500,000 TPD daily limit ✅

### Why One Sample at a Time?

```
abatch_score([sample_1])   → fires ~2 LLM calls concurrently (~2,752 tokens)
→ 40s cooldown             → sliding window partially resets (~1,833 tokens recovered)
abatch_score([sample_2])   → fires ~2 LLM calls (~2,752 tokens)
→ 40s cooldown
...
```

After 40s, the 60s sliding window has recovered `2752 × 40/60 ≈ 1,835 tokens`.  
Leftover from previous burst: `2,752 − 1,835 = 917 tokens`.  
Next burst adds 2,752 → total in window: **3,669 tokens** — safely under 6,000 TPM ✅

After processing all 15 samples, a full **62s cooldown** resets the window completely before the next experiment starts.

### `async_cooldown` vs `time.sleep`

We use `asyncio.sleep` (not `time.sleep`) for the cooldowns in `metrics.py`:

- `time.sleep` freezes the entire Python thread — no UI updates, no progress callbacks
- `asyncio.sleep` yields control back to the event loop — the Streamlit status callback can still fire dots while waiting

The Streamlit app uses `nest_asyncio.apply()` to allow async code to run from within Streamlit's synchronous context.

### Total Runtime

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 — 21 calls × 10s spacing | ~3.5 min |
| Phase 2 — 5 experiments × 15 samples × (processing + 40s cooldown) + 4 × 62s inter-experiment | ~70 min |
| **Total** | **~75 min** |

> Phase 2 is long by design — the 6,000 TPM on_demand ceiling forces per-sample pacing. Upgrade JUDGE_GROQ to Groq Dev Tier (100k TPM) to bring Phase 2 down to ~5 min. Actual runtime may vary ±10 min depending on API latency and any exponential-backoff retries on 429 responses.

## Part 5 — How to Run

### Local (development)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the FastAPI backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — start the Streamlit eval app
streamlit run evals/app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` and follow the 4 tabs:

1. **Ground Truth** — review the 15 golden Q&A pairs and 6 guardrails tests
2. **Live Pipeline** — click "Run Live Pipeline" to collect real responses (Phase 1 — ~3.5 min)
3. **Eval Metrics** — click "Run Eval Metrics" to score with RAGAS (Phase 2 — ~70 min on free Groq tier)
4. **History** — view all past eval runs stored in GCS; compare scores across runs with a trend chart

### Cloud Run (production)

The evals service is deployed to its own Cloud Run service (`{app_name}-evals`). Open the Cloud Run URL in a browser — it's the same Streamlit app. The `BACKEND_URL` env var is automatically set to the backend Cloud Run URL by Terraform, so Phase 1 will call the production backend.

> After each successful eval run, results are saved to `gs://{processed_bucket}/eval-results/` as a JSON file. The History tab loads these on startup — past runs persist across Cloud Run restarts.

All traces are visible in **Logfire** under `service = evals`.
