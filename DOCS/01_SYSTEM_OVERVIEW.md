# 🤖 Enterprise Agentic RAG: System Overview

A production-grade, state-of-the-art RAG system built for speed, scalability, and deep observability. This platform leverages **LangGraph** to handle complex reasoning and **Google Cloud** to handle massive data scales.

---

## 🌟 Vision
Most RAG systems fail because they treat every query the same. Our **Agentic RAG** distinguishes between:
1.  **Conversational Queries**: "Hi", "Who are you?", "What did I just say?"
2.  **Technical Queries**: "How do I configure Intel SRIOV on Kubernetes?"

By using a **Planner-Retriever-Responder** architecture, we ensure that technical answers are always grounded in "True Data" while conversational interactions remain fluid and fast.
